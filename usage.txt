1) Launch project
4) Run KHCityDatabaseCreator
   Note output: this shows which cities/countries can NOT be imported
5) Copy generated KHCityDatabase-compacted.realm and it's enclosing timestamped directory into KHCityDatabase/CreatedDatabase
6) Ensure that only the most recent KHCityDatabase/<timestamp>/KHCityDatabase-compacted.realm is added to the Xcode target KHCityDatabase
7) Run KHCityDatabaseFramework (target is irrelevant - it just runs a script)
   This updates the xcframework at XCFramework/xcframeworks/KHCityDatabase.xcframework
8) Commit everything if you haven't already
