1) Launch project
2) Run KHCityDatabaseCreator
   Note output: this shows which cities/countries can NOT be imported
3) Copy generated CityDatabase.sqlite* (3 files) into a timestamped directory into KHCityDatabase/CreatedDatabase
4) Ensure that only the most recent KHCityDatabase/<timestamp>/CityDatabase.sqlite* is added to the Xcode target KHCityDatabase
5) Run KHCityDatabaseFramework (target is irrelevant - it just runs a script)
   This updates the xcframework at XCFramework/xcframeworks/KHCityDatabase.xcframework
6) Commit everything if you haven't already
