1) Launch project
2) Ensure that ./KHCityDatabase/Realm-iOS is up-to-date
3) Ensure that ./KHCityDatabaseCreator/Realm-OSX is up-to-date
4) Run KHCityDatabaseCreator
   Note output: this shows which cities/countries can NOT be imported
5) Copy generated KHCityDatabase-compacted.realm and it's enclosing timestamped directory into KHCityDatabase/CreatedDatabase
6) Ensure that only the most recent KHCityDatabase-compacted.realm is added to the Xcode target in CurrentDatabase group
7) Run KHFatCityDatabase (target is irrelevant - it creates a fat framework)
   This updates the framework at ./KHCityDatabase.framework
8) Commit everything if you haven't already
